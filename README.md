# My First Website

This is my very first website project, created 5 years ago.  
It’s a simple **static webpage** built with just **HTML** and **CSS** — no frameworks or JavaScript involved.  

Even though it's basic, it represents the starting point of my web development journey and holds a special place in my learning experience.
